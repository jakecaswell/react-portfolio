# react-portfolio
This is my first attempt at making a react app and a new portfolio. On this website you can see some of the technologies that I have learned as a developer and some projects that I have worked on while learning new development skills. Take a look and get in touch through my github, linkedIn, or by sending an email! This is a work in progress as I am always looking to improve my skills as a developer and express myself to the best of my abilities to anyone that would be willing to look at them! Thank you for taking your time to look at some of my work.
